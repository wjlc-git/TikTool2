## UPDATED CODE

I updated this persons code, I did this to simply change the looks, and (somewhat) functions of it. I removed all the self-advertisment, and removed the non-functioning Instagram follow tool. It's mainly the visual changes, I will probably add rotating-proxies in the future, becasue this is a paid feature on the main code, but it'll be a free feature on my code. I will NOT be adding the Instagram features as I don't know how. I have also changed the description to remove all self-advertisement, and useless information,
